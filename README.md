## Technologies & tools
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [Anaconda]: or any other platform for python v3.8 or above
* [OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)]: it is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. 
* [Cvzone (Computer vision zone)] : This is a computer vision package that makes it easy to run Image processing and AI functions. At the core it uses OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries.
## Installation
***
Before you start writing the code, you need to install some packages: opencv, cvzone, mediapipe, pynput .
To do this , you have to go to anaconda prompt and type the following commands :

```
$ pip install opencv
$ pip install cvzone
$ pip install --user mediapipe
$ pip install pynput
```

# Good Luck
